# Clone Repository

GameQA consists of multiple repositories of code. To make this simpler for you, we've created a single umbrella repo: [cadia-lvl/GameQA](https://www.github.com/cadia-lvl/GameQA). 

To get started, clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal: 
```
$ git clone 'https://github.com/cadia-lvl/GameQA.git'
```

Once you're done, change directory as ```$ cd GameQA``` for the following steps.
