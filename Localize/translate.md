# Translate

In the ```GameQA``` directory, you will find a subdirectory ```repl``` that contains three ```.csv``` files:

1. ```repl_text.csv```
2. ```repl_emoji.csv```
3. ```repl_values.csv```

This file can be opened up with a spreadsheet editor. It has a handful of columns including the English translations of all text in GameQA. This includes all views, buttons, errors, alerts, instructions, etc. For each english translation there is context that explains the english translation and the purpose of each translation. The most important column in the translation.csv is the "translation" column. When you pull the repo for the first time, this column is empty. The first step to translate all text in the GameQA repo is to translate every single row.
