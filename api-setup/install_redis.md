# Installing REDIS

REDIS is an open source in-memory key-value store which sidesteps the need for slow disk reads. We use REDIS to speed up the API and reduce load on the database. In the next few steps, we will install and run docker both locally (on your machine) for any local testing or development you will do.

## Installing Docker
The best way to run redis locally is to use Docker to do so. If you do not already have Docker installed, here are installation instructions.
