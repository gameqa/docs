# Google Search Engine

Google Cloud provides a service called [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com) which provides us with an API access to its search engine.
We levarage this API during the Google Search Stage when we ask users to 
find answers to questions. This is a paid service with a number of free searches every single day. After that, you pay for every 1,000 search results. During the original data collection for GameQA we paid less than $100 for all 23,000 questions and 13,000 answers.
