# Setting up SendGrid

Sendgrid 
is an email service that sends signup and other standardized emails from GameQA. In order to a get a service like Sendgrid
to work there needs to be a certain level of integration and setup. However, we've taken care of most of the integration
so you will only need to add what is absolutely necessary.

Sendgrid is a paid service, however, the volume of emails sent out by the system is so low that it will likely
qualify for a free tier.
