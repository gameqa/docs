# Creating a Database

In order to run and use the API you will need to connect to a databse instance. This database will store all the data gathered by the users of the app. We use MongoDB in our deployment and recommend the same.


Here, we will walk you through the steps of creating a MongoDB instance and integrating it into the API.
