# GameQA-Localization

> Start Here.

Welcome to the GameQA documentation. Here you'll find a step-by-step tutorial to localize **GameQA** for your language / area and deploy it. The documentation starts with instructions on how to use our localization scripts to translate the codebase. Next, it will walk you through setting up the API and then the Mobile App. The last section will walk you through how to manage the data collection. We've worked to streamline the process as much as possible. This means that the process has as little manual work as possible. We've tried to abstract all code writing away from the localization.
