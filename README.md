# GameQA

> Welcome to the GameQA Localization Portal! Our goal is to empower low-resource languages by enabling the creation of diverse QA datasets. GameQA is an open-source, crowd-sourcing platform that gamifies data collection for these languages. This portal simplifies the localization process, helping you adapt GameQA to your needs and support linguistic diversity. Join us in democratizing knowledge and bridging the global linguistic gap.

## Localizing GameQA

The localization process for GameQA is designed to be straightforward and efficient, making it easy for you to adapt the platform for your specific linguistic needs. Begin by using our localization portal to translate the user interface components, which typically takes around 2-3 days. Following this, allocate 2-3 weeks for setting up the app, server, and conducting internal testing. Once everything is in place, start collecting data from crowdworkers through free contributions. The data collection period can range from 1 to 6 months, depending on your desired dataset size and project timeline.
